<p class="about">I was very excited and at the same time nervous while I started writing code for 
my website. Because, designing, developing and publishing a website from scratch is challenging 
for a newbie like me. It needs knowledge on HTML and CSS. It requires a platform to publish a 
website. GitHub is chosen as the platform since it provides a free platform to its users to 
publish a website. It also allows users to publish updated versions and yet the previous 
versions can be recovered if needed.</p> 
<p class="about">My first challenge was to gather enough knowledge to be able to start writing 
the HTML and CSS coding. First, I wrote only the HTML code and checked it in my local browser. 
As it worked it provides me great inspiration. Then I started writing CSS code. Applying the 
trial and error process I developed the HTML and CSS code. It was a tiresome process but at the 
same time interesting.</p> 
<p class="about">Making the design responsive is another challenge. But when I finished, it 
worked considerably well. The responsiveness of my website gives me a boost and inspires me 
to design more websites. After completing the code for the website, I am now confident that I 
can develop codes for a website based on a given design.</p>
