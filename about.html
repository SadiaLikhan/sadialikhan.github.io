<p class="about">
I am a positive and open minded person who loves to embrace new, innovative ideas, and explore new
 horizons. My passion is software and website development though my specialization is electric 
 power and e-drive systems. But I have been working in CMS based frontend web development for the 
 last 8 years though the attachment dimmed during the last 3 years since I started to continue my
 study again. I used to work with one of the popular CMS platforms Wordpress and had worked on the
 Upwork platform. Finally I decided to develop my IT skills since I could not resist my passion 
 towards the field. Since I worked with a customized CMS I have very little knowledge on practical 
 coding. So, I joined the AZURE Cloud Developer program in Jensen Education to improve and uphold 
 my coding capability.
